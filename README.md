# ðŸŽ¨ AssetKit
3D asset importer, exporter library. This library also includes common 3D utils funcs. It is written with C99 but C++ wrappers or other language bindings can be written in the future.

This library will full support COLLADA specs and glTF specs, plus other 3D formats e.g .obj, .stl maybe supported by sub-libraries e.g. assetkit-stl, assetkit-fbx.

There is also an optional renderer library called [libgk](https://github.com/recp/libgk) for render AssetKit contents. You can see how to load AssetKit to libgk in [assetkit-gl](https://github.com/recp/assetkit-gl) lib/repo.

I've also created a basic program (included a screenshot of render result and dae) to show full steps: [simple-collada-viewer](http://github.com/recp/simple-collada-viewer)

##Tasklist

- [x] Hierarchical Allocator
  - [x] Extensible memory node
- [x] Flexible Coordinate System, loader can laod any coords sys and can convert it to any coord sys even left handed
- [x] Implement RB-tree for ID resolver
- [x] Options
- [x] Load Core elements
  - [x] Geometries
    - [x] Meshes
      - [x] Load Polygons
      - [x] Load Triangles
      - [x] Load Lines
      - [x] Convert multi-index mesh to single-index mesh if wanted
         - [x] Find and fix edges attribs e.g. same position can't use different normals
      - [x] Convert mesh data (positions, normals...) to current coord sys
      - [x] Compute bounding box if wanted
      - [x] Triangulate Polygons if wanted
      - [x] Material resolver
      - [ ] Generate face normals if wanted
    - [x] B-rep
  - [x] Cameras
    - [x] Attach first found camera to scene as default camera
    - [x] Attach all camera instances to scene
  - [x] Scenes
     - [x] Nodes
       - [x] Fix camera node transform
       - [x] Transforms
         - [x] Utils for transforms
         - [x] Convert transforms to current coord sys
       - [x] Implement bind_material 
  - [x] Load external DAE files and cache them 
  - [ ] Load animations
    - [ ] Parse MathML formulas
- [x] Load FX
- [ ] Load Physics
- [ ] Load Kinematics
- [ ] Exporting

#Â Notes
- Actual README and documents for how to use this will be written after first version
- I'm working hard to finish this lib, I'll update README when finished, for now <b>DON'T USE THIS LIB UNTIL FINISHED</b>
- Don't create pull requests for now, if you really want then, first contact me because I may work on the feature you want or I've planned it with an architecture to do that
